Less is known of "The Mule" than of any character of comparable signifigance to Galactic history. His real name is unknown; his early life mere conjecture. Even the period of his greatest renown is known to us chiefly through the eyes of his antagonists and, principally, through those of a young bride. </p>_

## What is MULE?

**MULE** is a centralised repository for the **M**easurement and **U**tilisation of **L**ight **E**xperiments at the University of Manchester's neutrino lab.

The functionality of this repository should cover:
- **Data acquisition** and **processing** using the WaveDump 1 and 2 software for **PMTs** and **SiPMs** interfaced with CAEN hardware,
- **Analysis software** and scripts implemented directly upon the acquired data or provided for use once data is processed,
- **Adequate documentation** to allow for simple use of the respective tools provided within this repository.

## Getting Started

The simplest method of installation is one done by cloning the github repository and running the setup.sh file from the terminal, as explained below.

To clone the directory, one should have `git` installed for their terminal.

Then, one can clone the repo to the desired directory. The environemnt then needs to be created and activated. This can be achieved by running the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/nu-ZOO/MULE.git
cd MULE
source setup.sh
```
> **_WARNING_** The above code will attempt to install miniconda

> **_WARNING_** The `setup.sh` currently only works on x86_64 machines with plans to fix this in the future

> **_NOTE_** The above link is taken from the repo's github page

One can also create an alias to activate the environment easily on every session.

## Usage

Usage is currently focused on binary files for readout from the above named systems.

To process a file with a pack using MULE, one should create a config file with the required input parameters.

> **_NOTE_** One can find the config files in /MULE/packs/configs

Once the config file has been edited and saved, one can execute the program from the terminal, including the location of the config file if necessary. For instance,

`mule proc process_WD2_3channel.conf`

While choice of packs remains limited, there is work being done to expand this. As such, the pack `proc` above is only an example and one should make an appropriate choice of pack. The general form of the above is,

`mule <PACK> <CONFIG>`

This will generate the output processed file and store them in the predefined location.

## MULE Auxilary Tools

There are several additonal processing functions which are not yet run automatically from the config file but that can be found in /MULE/packs/proc
