Welcome to the MULE docs!
================================

**MULE** is a centralised repository for the data acquisition and analysis software used within the University of Manchester's neutrino lab.

The functionality of this repository should cover:

* Data acquisition and processing for PMTs and SiPMs interfaced with CAEN hardware/software,
* Analysis software and scripts implemented directly upon the acquired data or provided for use once data is processed,
* Adequate documentation to allow for simple use of the respective tools provided within this repository.

.. note::
   This repository is still under active development. Help is much appreciated :)
